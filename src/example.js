// this code is an example code of how to add a command to merlins functionality, if you just want a simple command, you can check the already made commands in the commands folder in src\

// but if you want to make a command with arguments, then you can use this code example here or read the docs for more.

/*
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';

export const command = {
  fix: 'Hello from the ping file',
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
    .setName('define')
    .setDescription('Look up a word in the encyclopedia.')
    .addStringOption((option) =>
      option.setName('term').setDescription('The word to look up in the encyclopedia.').setRequired(true)
    ),
  async execute(interaction) {
    const term = interaction.options.getString('term');
    
    // Now you can use the 'term' variable to make your API request to define the term in the encyclopedia.
    // For example:
    // const definition = await makeApiRequestToDefineTerm(term);

    await interaction.reply(`You want to define: ${term}`);
    // Replace the above line with sending the actual definition retrieved from your API.
  },
};

In this code, we've added an argument to the define command called term. It's defined using the addStringOption method, which allows users to input a string argument when invoking the command.

When the command is executed, the execute function will be called. Inside this function, we retrieve the term argument using interaction.options.getString('term'). Now, you can use this term variable to make your API request to define the word in the encyclopedia. Replace the example line (await interaction.reply(...)) with the actual API request to get the definition.

When a user sends the command /define encyclopedia, your bot will extract the argument "encyclopedia" and use it to fetch the definition using your API. The bot will then reply with the definition or information you retrieved from the API.

Remember to implement the actual API request logic in the execute function to fetch the definition based on the provided term. The example above demonstrates how to handle command arguments, and you can adapt it to fit your specific API and use case.
